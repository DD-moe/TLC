        <h2>Welcome to TLC Analysis App – Please Read Before Starting</h2>
        
        <p>We highly recommend reviewing the documentation below before initiating your first analysis. This ensures you understand the methodology, parameters, and limitations of the application.</p>
        
        <section id="module-instruction">
            <h3>1. The "Instruction" Tab: Methodology and Usage Guide</h3>
            <p>This section is crucial for a full understanding of the application's capabilities. Here you will find:</p>
            <ul>
                <li>Comprehensive details on **all quantitative, qualitative, and optimization parameters** used in the chromatographic calculations.</li>
                <li>**Formulas and definitions** for calculating key parameters, along with diagrams illustrating how the application processes data.</li>
                <li>A detailed **step-by-step user guide** to all application functionalities.</li>
            </ul>
        </section>

        <section id="module-examples">
            <h3>2. The "Examples" Tab: Testing Data</h3>
            <p>The "Examples" tab contains TLC plate images utilized for testing the application throughout all stages of its development, from initial algorithms to its current state.</p>
        </section>

        <section id="module-versions">
            <h3>3. Other Projects: "V5" and "V6"</h3>
            <p>While **"V3"** is the primary version, we encourage you to explore our advanced projects:</p>
            <ul>
                <li>**V6 Algorithms:** A collection of independent algorithms that served to optimize the background reconstruction method. This advancement eliminates the need for image downscaling during background estimation.</li>
                <li>**V5 - Fully Automated Processing:** This version is designed for fully automatic data processing, from image upload to report generation (currently available in Polish only). Its architecture supports automatic modification by an AI in certain aspects, such as adjusting the number of images analyzed simultaneously for different light wavelengths, or modifying the visual layout. This may potentially simplify the workflow for non-technical users.</li>
            </ul>
